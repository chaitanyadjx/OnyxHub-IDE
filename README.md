## About Project

Gloried HTML reader, made with Go and Wails. Has some issues. Still working on them. Feel free to contribute.
Basically, idea is to view the prototype design as HTML and easy to view rather than opening in browser. And easier to view and make small changes.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
